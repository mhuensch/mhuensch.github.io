but I wanted something that was more like a campaign and less like a board game with stickers.  Gloomhaven was close, but it was a bit too light on theme and high-level strategy and a bit to0 heavy on battle tactics for our group.  </p><p>I found KDM, read some reviews, and thought "this could be it!".  I then started watching youtube videos and reading articles trying to get a sense of what the "gameplay" was like.  Our experience with Gloomhaven was still sharp in my mind and I didn't want to spend $400.00 on another miss.  But after a week, I still didn't have a really good idea if KDM was a good fit for us.  </p><p><strong>After playing KDM a ton, I now understand the problem. </strong></p><p>KDM is divided into "lantern years" where each year represents a series of phases you play through (hunt, showdown, settlement).  Each lantern year takes our group 1 to 2 hours to complete and a campaign can last 20 to 30 years.  Yea, a KDM campaign is <strong>long.</strong>  It's more like a D&amp;D campaign than a legacy board game.  You can't really get a feeling for a game like that from a short "Learn to play KDM" video on youtube or a review on Board Game Geek.</p><p>To make matters worse, the core KDM campaign begins with a White Lion intro battle that is incredibly boring, tedious, and straightforward compared to the rest of the game.  KDM builds slowly at first, so even lantern years 2 and 3 aren't much better from a new player's game experience.  So if you only play KDM for an hour or two, you have a very weird idea of what the gameplay is like and thats the part of the game that most mainstream reviews or how-to's have experience with.</p><p>Often, you're no better off reading things written by the people who love KDM and know it best.  There's a huge wealth of information surrounding KDM and it's impossible for an outsider to digest and form a high-level picture of what the game is all about from that amount of detail.</p><p>I think the best thing to do is to find a group of people who KDM and sit in on one of their games.  If you're an anti-social loner introvert like me, you can probably substitute sitting in on an actual game with watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8VUPPM98vay95WXgem2ZXwRZkg8rlZlO">On Table Top's "Let's Play Kingdom Death" videos</a> where they play through 14 lantern years.</p><p>Finally, I suggest that if you're at all interested in trying Kingdom Death: Monster, just bite the bullet and buy a copy despite the $400.00 price tag.  It's well worth the money, and if you totally hate the game, you can always sell it used for near cost or in pieces to make a profit.</p><h2 id="paperwork-horror">Paperwork Horror</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image.png 600w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image.png 1000w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/02/image.png 1600w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image.png 2222w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote><em>Above: </em><a href="https://foundingstone.blog/kdm/hobby/"><em>Founding Stone's KDM blog</em></a><em>. Yes, even when well organized, KDM takes up the entire table and often overflows to other tables.  </em></blockquote><p>While you quickly adapt to monsters with human hands being ejected from their anus, you <strong>never</strong> really get over the feeling that you spend half of your life filling out paperwork.  The KDM community is amazing and there is a wide variety of fan created templates, organizers, and apps to help you keep your head above the organizational deluge; but nothing really fixes the problem entirely.  Apps are by far the most helpful solution (we like <a href="https://blackledger.ca/">BlackLedger</a> the best so far), but they have their own faults.  Don't get me wrong, I get obsessed with organization and logging too, but doing so in real-time detracts from the overall theme and experience of playing KDM.  To that end, one of the things I hope to produce for the community is a <a href="https://mhuensch.github.io/kdmai/">new solution</a> that eliminates the overhead while keeping everyone's head in the game.</p><h2 id="pile-of-grey-shame">Pile of Grey Shame</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-1.png 600w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image-1.png 982w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>Above: <a href="https://mhuensch.github.io/home/vibrantlantern">Vibrant Lantern</a> is an excellent resource for assembling KDM miniatures</blockquote><p>If you have any experience at all with miniature gaming, you've probably seen a number of "un-painted" miniature memes.  Fortunately, KDM has a small set of miniatures to assemble and paint - in comparison to most war games.   Unfortunately, I see a ton of people on reddit who love playing KDM but have little or no experience assembling and painting miniatures.  The <a href="https://mhuensch.github.io/home/vibrantlantern">Vibrant Lantern</a> website is an excellent resource for assembling KDM miniatures, but there isn't really an equivalent site for painting KDM mins for beginners.  Sure, you can spend a lot of time watching youtube videos or reading blogs to develop your painting and modeling skills, but who has time to do all that when you have so much KDM to play?  So, I've spent some time <a href="https://mhuensch.github.io/painting/">developing a painting recipe</a> that should help even a total noob paint awesome minis with a minimal investment of material and time. </p><h2 id="new-content">New Content?</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/image-4.png 600w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-4.png 1000w, https://mhuensch.github.io/content/images/2021/02/image-4.png 1518w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><blockquote>Above: Fen creates a ton of content for KDM in addition to contributing to the Community Edition of KDM and answering rules questions on KDM.  Seriously,<a href="https://www.patreon.com/FenPaints"> support him at Patreon</a>.</blockquote><p>Did I mention how awesome the KDM community is?  Not only does the community produce log sheets, apps, etc; there's a ton of content you can find in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KingdomDeath/comments/bclbyf/community_edition_phase_201_released/">Community Edition of KDM</a>.  There are community expansions and upgrades as well as rule changes and clarifications mostly available for free.  We are still waiting for Adam Poots to release the official version of "Campaigns of Death" so we can create our own campaigns, but while we wait it's nice to know there are new things from the community we can explore.  Either way, once you have new content from the community or your own generated campaign, you'll probably want new miniatures to accompany your adventures.   I believe 3D printing is the answer to our greedy little heart's desires.  You can find models on sites like <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a> and <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/">My Mini Factory</a> that fit the theme and print them out using a 3D printer.  However, printing miniatures isn't like downloading a new settlement pdf and kicking it over to your inkjet.  There's a lot more going on with 3D printing and it can be intimidating and frustrating to get started.  So, I've started to collect a set of resources specifically related to<a href="https://mhuensch.github.io/printing/"> 3D printing miniatures for KDM</a>.</p>
